# Apache Spark Experiments

These are my personal experiments with Apache Spark and its comparison with Pandas. It uses GOOG stock data obtained using yfinance as well.

The "Setup" folder contains the Dockerfile I used to start the developer enviroment. Docker-compose will expect that this directory is renamed to "~/spark" so that it can mount to it.
